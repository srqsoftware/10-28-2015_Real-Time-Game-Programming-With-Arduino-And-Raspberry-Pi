# Overview

The Arduino micro-controller is a popular tool used by makers, artists and engineers to develop a variety of computer controlled projects. This talk will introduce the conception, design and implementation of an arcade game powered entirely by an Arduino and its presentation at Maker Faire Orlando on Sept 12-13, 2015. The Raspberry Pi was used for Audio/Visual enhancements. Topics will be some electronic design (high level), software design, software implementation, testing, problems & resolutions and future evolution. We will discuss Arduino (C programming) interfacing with Python/Pygame on Raspberry Pi.
